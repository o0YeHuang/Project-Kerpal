    <h1>Team Kerpal - Final Report</h1>
    <br />
    <h2>Overall Dev Experiences</h2>
    <h3>HW1</h3>
    <p>
        Working on HW1 was very interesting. All of us were definitely taking CSS for granted, and the level of ease it provides in styling web pages.
        So when we had to make our soundboard using just presentational HTML, it was difficult and challenging. However by doing this, along with
        developing the HTML tag test page, it really helped us understand HTML much better, such as block vs. inline elements, and element attributes
        such as "srcset" which none of us knew had existed.
    </p>
    <h3>HW2</h3>
    <p>
        HW2 is where the first real version of our soundboard came to life (in the vanilla version). All three of already has some preconceived notions
        about Twitter Bootstrap, some good, some bad, but mostly bad. By using Bootstrap, we were quickly reminded how inefficent Bootstrap is, and in our
        opinion not that time-saving at all, especially when you have some basic CSS understanding. Going from that image of what a web page looks like
        in your head to actual HTML/CSS code, is much easier with vanilla css in our opinion. Bootstrap to us is the enemy of creativity; we don't need any
        more cookie-cutter designs.
    </p>
    <h3>HW3</h3>
    <p>
        HW3 was very techincal, which we all love as CS/CE students. Using vanilla.js and Vue.js, we were able to create and make use of "custom" HTML
        components in different ways. In our vanilla.js version we made use of the template tag to template our "sound" container, which was dynamically
        added to a soundboard container on the DOM via Javascript after fetching/parsing  sounds from a JSON file. With Vue.js we also made use of template tags, but in a different
        manner. Instead of adding these "sounds" to a soundboard container dynamically with Javascript, we made use of special Vue.js methods/attributes such as v-for, and prop binding
        (assign props to these sound elements).
    </p>
    <h3>HW4</h3>
    <p>
        HW4 awarded us the opportunity to polish our vanilla.js version of the Kerpal soundboar from HW3, as well as make it a progressive web application by using service-workers. In terms of polishing
        we fixed a lot of aesthetic errors that we were having at various screen sizes, made all of our Javascript code ES5/6 compliant (with minor tweaks to some eslint rules), refactored Javascript functions
        that were messy or violating SRP or DRY principles. We also used Gulp to create tasks to help minify our CSS and optimize images so that we can reduce file sizes and therefore page load time. By making our
        soundboard a PWA, we quickly saw the advantages of "offline first" thinking, especially in performance with respect bandwidth usage and page load time. By caching major assets, our soundboard became much faster
        to load on mobile devices and on a PC we got very close to the holy grail of RAIL times.

    <br />
    <p>
        Quickly glancing through this table, we can observe how our soundboard has gotten better, solely looking at those performance metrics. The clear loser by far is our
        Twitter Bootstrap version. In HW3 we also see an improvement of page load time by incorporating the use of javascript to dynamically set/get images and sounds instead of
        hardcoding the source URL's into img and audio tags. Finally, our PWA version in offline mode is simply the best. We now firmly believe that an "offline-first" approach is
        extremely underrated. Users can leverage offline PWA's more than they think. When a user has a speedy/stable connection such as WiFi, then a PWA can refresh/rebuild it's cache
        at this time.

    <h2>Potential Areas of Improvement (if only we had more than 5 weeks)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Sprite all the images together into one image - this would greatly reduce the number of image requests</li>
      <li>Concatenate all the mp3's together into a single webm file - this would greatly reduce the number of sound requests</li>
      <li>Add user login & registration</li>
      <li>Ability to create your own soundboard</li>
    </ul>
