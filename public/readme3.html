    <p>When looking at file sizes alone, the Vanilla JS version is much, much better
      than the Vue.js version of our site. Both versions use Sentry/Raven.js for
      error tracking, so nothing can be improved upon there since their required libraries
      are linked. The Vanilla JS versions only further requires "index.js", summing to a total
      of 33,159 bytes of JS required (index.js and raven.min.js). The Vue.js version required considerablbly
      more javascript code since it needs "index.vue.js" (our implementation of the site using Vue.js), "vue.min.js"
      (Vue.js library), "axios.min.js" (Fetch library used instead of XMLHttpRequest), and also "raven.min.js".
      This totals to 126,649 bytes of JS required for the Vue.js version. This is almost four times the amount of JS required
      for the vanilla version which definitely causes increased page load times.

    <br />
    <p>
      On a mobile device, the Vue.js version was not that much slower than the Vanilla JS versions, equating to about a 12% slow down. On the PC, the Vanilla JS
      versions was much faster than the Vue.js version, being about 66% faster. This is interesting to note for the mobile devices because Vue.js is definitely making more requests
      for JS (as noted previously), but there was not much of a an overall slowdown on a throttled 3G connection. It seems to us that the asynchronicity of the JS code for both versions
      is more apparent on the mobile device tests throttled at 3G speeds. On a PC with an unthrottled connection is where we see the difference between the Vanilla JS and Vue.js versions.

    <h2>Developer Experience</h2>
    <p>
        Developing for the Vanilla JS version was a much better experience for the Kerpal team. We found it easy to
        find documentation for any implementation questions that we faced. This was NOT the case for our Vue.js version.
        Vue.js has a bit of a learning curve and we believe their documentation is lacking in certain areas. We struggled with
        figuring out how to bind component props to actual html elements themselves, only to realize it was a minor syntax issue
        that was not apparent in the Vue.js docs. Furthermore, both the implementations we wrote for the Vanilla JS and Vue.js versions
        were nearly the same line count, there was no added developer experience here by using Vue.js. On the contrary, we felt that by using
        Vue.js, the developer experience for us went way down due to lack of solid documentation and examples regarding more complex components, binding
        props to them, and dynamically or iteratively adding these Vue.js templated components.
